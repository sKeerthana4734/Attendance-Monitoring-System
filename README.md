The student's captured face image is saved with the current date and time in a separate directory for reference when required.
* Training platform: Google colab
* Data Annotation: LabelImg from python package
* Model: Faster RCNN
* Data Source: Realtime student images
* Front-end: HTML, CSS
* Back-end: Python flask
